# booknote

This is a tiny note-taking language that I made using a Vim syntax file. I eventually switched to [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).

## Installation

1. Copy booknote.vim to ~/.vim/syntax/
2. Copy filetype.vim to ~/.vim/

If ~/.vim/filetype.vim already exists, you'll need to manually merge the two files.
This should only happen if you've defined custom filetypes without the aid of a plugin manager, in which case you probably know what you're doing.
